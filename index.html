The Central Bank of Kenya in its mandate to keep in check the economy through its monetary policy guidelines uses various instruments to achieve this objective. Even though this study area has been explored by various researchers it is evident that there are very little content on the effect of monetary policy on inflation. Because of the need to fill the knowledge gap this research study will seek to explore on the effect of monetary policy on specific commercial banking rates such as fixed deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, lending rates and local money market rates. This research will be anchored on monetary policy theory, Taylor`s theory, Keynesian theory and credit market theory of inflation. The researcher will adopt a descriptive research design. A questionnaire will be used. The data collected will be coded, quantified and analyzed quantitatively using Statistical package for social scientists.
